# lcars_lovelace
This is a mod of the https://github.com/th3jesta/ha-lcars (Thanks!)
I've add four more classes:
sensor-lozenge
sensor-lozenge-right
sensor-button
sensor-button-right

and some variables to change the aspect of the buttons and sensors. 

It is a mess of code. It's is quick and dirty. Use under your responsibilty, and better than copy&paste, study the code and create yours. I'm sure it'll be better than mine.

There is also the yaml code for the dashboard I've created in my home asssitant to control my installation.
